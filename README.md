# Open CV in python
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that includes various computer vision and machine learning algorithms. It supports multiple programming languages and platforms.

Here, in practice file-1, I used a sample image with some basic operations to understand the structure of OpenCV, such as loading an image, resizing, rotating, displaying, and saving.

<div align="center">
    <img src="sample%20img.jpg" alt="Sample image" width="200">
</div>


- In file 2, Accessing a specific pixel value in the image can be done using array indexing is done,
- Changing the colors of pixels by iterating through the image array and assigning new values is done,
- Copying a particular part of image and pasting it to another part is done.
